# About the Folders:

To run this project we used three commands that mentioned in the Github.
for the input arguments CSBD can be run in 2 modes: 
(1)	Random split classification - In random split mode, the apps in the given dataset are split into training and test sets and are used to train and evaluate the malware detection model, respectively.

(2)	Holdout classification - In the holdout classification mode, separate training and test sets could be provided by the user. 

-	python2 Main.py –help 

-	python2 Main.py --randomsplit 1 --maldir C:\Users\hille\Documents\app_os_android\drebin_apps --gooddir C:\Users\hille\Documents\app_os_android\benign_dat #

There are 2 main files in this ZIP.
1.	Project-running – that folder contain three video. The first one is the running of the first and the second comment, the second video is the end of the second commend and the third video is the running of the third command which took us 72 hours so we gave a short video that visualize the download and running of the data-set into our M.L model.
We took a picture of the end of all the process.

2.	O_S_android_malware  - this is the document of the paper which represent in the Github.
